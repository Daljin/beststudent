# beststudent
Hello and welcome to beststudent! This'll be the repo for beststudent, where you can find the tools and resources.
## The Goal
So the goal of beststudent is to aid students in staying on top of their classes. We'll be using Android Studio to bring this idea to life. 

## Minimum Viable Product
- The ability to add class times
- The task be sorted by categories (class, extracurricular, personal, etc)
- The goods that would help students such as pomodoro, schedules, etc..
### Backend:
- Handles the addition of classes by the user.
- The pomodoro timer + breaks.
- Portion of the app that allows users to keep a checklist, and allows tasks to be sorted by categories.
### Frontend
- Implementing the frontend design of the app
- Launching the app should reveal the App's name: BestStudent followed by a quote
- Total of 3 minimum screens.
- Schedule screen where they can see where their classes are at + extracurriculars. 
- Tasks screen where they can see their checklist. 
- Third screen where the pomodoro timer is at.

## Ideas after the MVP
- Integrate a mood reader after every session. This could help students if they are unhappy and could send a concern message to their love one's. The mood reader could also predict best time to study
- Have a basic day to day task (like drink 8 bottles of water) and have user tick each glass of water to indicate there progess.
- An option to post links about studying techniques.
- More will be added after we brainstorm.
